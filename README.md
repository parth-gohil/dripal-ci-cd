# drupal-ci-cd
A demo repository to showcase GitHub Actions pushing code to an autoscaling group on AWS

* The repository follows Drupal standard practices for deployment. 
* The CI/CD pipeline is just a demo. Ideally there would a lot of changes to make it production ready, but as a proof of concept this works!
